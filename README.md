# HotoVaga
Not your typical rock paper scissors!
HotoVaga is a game has been implemented using python as our coding language, OpenCV as
our library for this computer vision project. In order to determine the player's move
and generate a random move for the AI, hand tracking has been used. We tried to
make our AI friend do two things, which are:
1. Learning to recognize our hand signs.
2. Afterwards playing its own random move.
The game is composed of a series of “rounds” where the player and the AI each make
a choice between rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined. The game
ends when you stop the code from running.
